Sundials CVODE examples in Ocaml
--------------------------------
This directory contains all of the Sundials CVODE examples from the original
distribution recoded in Ocaml. For the most part these examples have been
translated directly into an imperative Ocaml style.

The examples can be compiled and their output compared with that of the
original examples by running:
    make tests.log; cat tests.log

and if the libraries have been compiled with LAPACK support:
    make lapack-tests.log

The original examples are found at the path specified in Makefile.inc:
    EXAMPLES_ROOT

Their output may differ from that of the ocaml versions depending on several
compilation options that affect the precision of floating point
calculations. There is an excellent description of the general issues at:
    http://www.christian-seiler.de/projekte/fpmath/

But for Sundials and Ocaml we found that:

* For an ocaml program using the interface and compiled into native code
  with ocamlopt, we could replicate the results of a C program compiled
  directly against Sundials by not using the -O1 nor -O2 options in the
  latter.

* For an ocaml program using the interface and compiled into byte code with
  ocamlc, we could replicate the results of a C program compiled directly
  against Sundials by using either the options:
	-mfpmath=sse -march=pentium4 (with or without -O2)
  or:
	--ffloat-store (with or without -O2)

* Alternatively, we could obtain identical results by setting the internal
  precision of the FPU to double (i.e. compile cvode_ml_nvec.c with the
  option -DRESTRICT_INTERNAL_PRECISION).

The examples include explicit calls to Gc.compact() to test the pointer
handling and finalisation calls of the OCaml interface routines.
