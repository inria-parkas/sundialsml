It provides an OCaml interface to most features of Sundials
version {b {var version}}.
There is no support for nvectors based on CUDA, Hypre ParVector, PETSC,
RAJA, Trilinos, HIP, SYCLC, or Kokkos; nor for linear solvers requiring CUDA,
PETSCSNES, MAGMA, SuperLU_DIST, Kokkos, or Ginkgo; nor for XBraid.
These features require libraries that are not available
in OCaml—{{:mailto:tim\@tbrk.org}contact us} if you need them.

{2:overview Overview}

This interface provides access to the {!Cvode}, {!Cvodes}, {!Ida}, {!Idas},
{!Kinsol}, and {!Arkode} modules.
Its structure mostly follows that of the original library,
both for ease of reading the official documentation and for converting
existing source code, but several changes have been made for programming
convenience and to increase safety, namely:
- solver sessions are mostly configured via algebraic data types
  rather than multiple function calls;
- errors are signalled by exceptions, not return codes;
- user data is shared between callback routines via closures (partial
  function applications);
- vectors are checked for compatibility using a combination
  of static and dynamic checks; and
- explicit free commands are not necessary since OCaml is a garbage-collected
  language.

Functions have been renamed according to a regular scheme. Leading {e
module identifiers} are replaced by module paths, words
beginning with an uppercase letter are separated by underscores and put
into lowercase. For instance, [IdaSetErrHandlerFn], becomes
{!Ida.set_err_handler_fn}, and [CVSpilsSetJacTimes] becomes
{!Cvode.Spils.set_jac_times}.

Constants are replaced by variant types in most cases. They are renamed by
conversion to {e CamlCase} and the removal of underscores. For instance,
[SUN_PREC_NONE] becomes
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Iterative.preconditioning_type}PrecNone}.
The names chosen for exceptions sometimes differ from the corresponding return
code names when this improves consistency or comprehensibility.
For instance, the return codes [CV_FIRST_RHSFUNC_ERR] and
[IDA_FIRST_RES_FAIL] become, respectively, the exceptions
{!Cvode.FirstRhsFuncFailure} and {!Ida.FirstResFuncFailure}, and [CV_BAD_IS]
becomes {!Cvodes.Sensitivity.BadSensIdentifier}.

Rather than duplicate the comprehensive
{{:https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}
Sundials user manuals}, this documentation provides brief summaries
with references to the original texts and underlying functions.

{3:nvector Nvectors}

Sundials defines an abstract interface for vectors and provides
several instantiations.
The OCaml interface defines likewise a generic
{!Nvector.t} type whose type arguments indicate the underlying {e
data} and {e kind}.
The {!Nvector.unwrap} function gives direct access to the underlying data.

The interface to serial nvectors, {!Nvector_serial}, is based on
{{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Bigarray.html}Bigarrays}.
These arrays are manipulated directly, i.e., with no additional overhead,
within the solver by the original low-level serial nvector operations
(see {!Nvector.NVECTOR_OPS}).
The same low-level operations can be called from OCaml
({!Nvector_serial.Ops}), as can equivalent OCaml reimplementations on the
underlying data ({!Nvector_serial.DataOps}).

The interface to parallel nvectors, {!Nvector_parallel}, is based on
{{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Bigarray.html}Bigarrays}
and the {{:https://github.com/xavierleroy/ocamlmpi/}OCamlMPI}
library. Parallel nvectors are only available when Sundials/ML is configured
to build with MPI.

The {!Nvector.any} type provides alternatives to the standard nvector types.
It replaces the static typing of the {e data} and {e kind} arguments with
dynamic checks on the extensible {!Nvector.gdata} type. This approach is
exploited in the {e many} nvectors, like {!Nvector_many},
{!Nvector_mpimany}, or {!Nvector_mpiplusx}, that group and operate on arrays
of nvectors.

Besides the standard implementations, it is also possible to define
new nvector implementations through {!Nvector_custom} by providing low-level
operations on an underlying datatype. A demonstration of this feature on
float arrays is provided in {!Nvector_array}. Custom nvectors suffer two
disadvantages compared to the standard nvector implementations. First, each
low-level operation incurs the cost of a callback into OCaml. Second, of all
the provided linear solvers, only {!Cvode.Diag} can be used; although it is
also possible to implement custom solvers in OCaml.

{3:matrix Matrices}

Sundials defines an abstract interface for matrices and provides
dense, banded, and sparse (either in compressed-sparse-column or
compressed-sparse-row format) implementations.
The OCaml interface defines likewise a generic
{{!Sundials_Matrix.t}Matrix.t} type whose type
arguments indicate the underlying {e matrix content} and the {e data} and
{e kind} of nvectors used in the
{{!Sundials_Matrix.matvec}Matrix.matvec} operation.
There are specific submodules for {{!Sundials_Matrix.Dense}dense},
{{!Sundials_Matrix.Band}band}, and
{{!Sundials_Matrix.Sparse}sparse} content.
It is also possible to define custom matrix types by providing a set of
standard {{!Sundials_Matrix.matrix_ops}matrix operations} to the
{{!Sundials_Matrix.wrap_custom}Matrix.wrap_custom}
function.
Some low-level matrix routines on arrays are provided by
{{!Sundials_Matrix.ArrayDense}Matrix.ArrayDense} and
{{!Sundials_Matrix.ArrayBand}Matrix.ArrayBand}.

{3:nonlinsolv Nonlinear Solvers}

Nonlinear algebraic systems occur optionally in the solution of ODE initial
value problems with {!Cvode}, invariably when solving DAE initial value
problems with {!Ida}, and when solving implicit problems or problems
involving a mass matrix with {!Arkode}.
Sundials provides generic {{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.Newton}Newton} and
{{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.FixedPoint}Fixed-point} nonlinear solvers.
It is also possible to define {{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.Custom}Custom}
nonlinear solvers by providing appropriate OCaml functions.

The user of a nonlinear solver, whether a Sundials module or OCaml program,
provides callback functions that describe the
{{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.set_sys_fn}system},
the {{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.set_lsetup_fn}setup} and
{{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.set_lsolve_fn}solution} of linear equations,
and a {{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.set_convtest_fn}convergence test}.
It then invokes the {{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.setup}setup} and
{{!Sundials_NonlinearSolver.solve}solve} functions.

{3:linsolv Linear Solvers}

{!Sundials.NonlinearSolver}s and the {!Kinsol} solver both require the
solution of systems of linear equations for which Sundials provides four
options:
{ul
    {- The {e diagonal approximation} of Jacobians by difference equations (only
    for {!Cvode});}
    {- {e Direct Linear Solvers (DLS)} requiring user-supplied callback
    functions that explicitly compute a Jacobian;}
    {- {e Scaled Preconditioned Iterative Linear Solvers (SPILS)}
    requiring user-supplied callback functions to setup and solve
    linear preconditioning systems;}
    {- {e Custom linear solvers} defined by a set of OCaml functions.}
}

The {{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Direct}DLS routines} are only available to
sessions that use serial, Pthreads, or OpenMP nvectors.
The external SuperLU_MT and KLU libraries are required for working with
sparse Jacobians.
Callback functions manipulate Jacobian matrices through the operations in
{{!Sundials_Matrix.Dense}Matrix.Dense},
{{!Sundials_Matrix.Band}Matrix.Band}, and
{{!Sundials_Matrix.Sparse}Matrix.Sparse}.

The {{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Iterative}SPILS routines} include the
{e Scaled Preconditioned GMRES (SPGMR)}, {e
Scaled Preconditioned Bi-CGStab (SPBCG)}, {e Scaled Preconditioned TFQMR
(SPTFQMR)}, {e Scaled Preconditioned Flexible GMRES (SPFGMR)}, and
{e Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG)} methods.
Additionally, {!Cvode} provides banded preconditioners
for sessions that use serial, Pthreads, or OpenMP nvectors.
Access to the underlying solver
routines on bigarrays is provided via the submodules of
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Iterative.Algorithms}LinearSolver.Iterative.Algorithms}.
Parallel Band-Block-Diagonal (BBD) preconditioners are available to sessions
that use parallel nvectors—see {!Cvode_bbd}, {!Cvodes_bbd}, {!Ida_bbd},
{!Idas_bbd}, and {!Kinsol_bbd}.

Using a linear solver requires three steps:
{ol
    {- Create a generic instance of {{!Sundials_LinearSolver.t}LinearSolver.t}}.
    {- Use it to instantiate a solver-specific instance, e.g.,
	{!Cvode.linear_solver} or
	{!Cvodes.Adjoint.linear_solver}.}
    {- Pass the solver-specific instance to appropriate [init] or [reinit]
	functions, e.g., {!Cvode.init} or {!Ida.reinit},
	to create or configure a session.}
}

Any given generic instance, and hence a solver-specific instance, of a
linear solver can only be associated with one solver session.

Custom linear solvers can be created by providing a set of operations to
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Custom.make_dls}LinearSolver.Custom.make_dls},
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Custom.make_with_matrix}LinearSolver.Custom.make_with_matrix},
or
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Custom.make_without_matrix}LinearSolver.Custom.make_without_matrix}.

{2:install Installation}

The dependencies of Sundials/ML are
- {{:http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/}OCaml} {b 4.03.0 or greater},
- {{:https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials}Sundials} {b {var version}}
  (compiles with version back to 2.7.0 with less features),
- {e Optionally}:
  {{:https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamlmpi/}OCamlMPI} {b 1.05}.

Normally, to install Sundials/ML, you need only type
[opam install sundialsml].

The following sections provide more detailed information on building and
installing Sundials and Sundials/ML.

{3:opam Installing Sundials/ML with OPAM}

The {{:https://opam.ocaml.org}OPAM} package manager provides the easiest way
to install Sundials/ML and the underlying Sundials library.
The features available in Sundials/ML depend on the version and options of
the underlying library (see {!Sundials.Config}).

{ol
    {- {i Optionally} run [opam install mpi].}
    {- Run [opam depext sundialsml].}
    {- Run [opam install sundialsml].}
}

If OPAM fails to install the required Sundials package automatically, then
try using your system's package manager directly, for example:
{ul
    {- Debian/Ubuntu: [apt-get install libsundials-dev]}
    {- Fedora:
	    [dnf install lapack-devel sundials-devel
	    sundials-threads-devel sundials-openmpi-devel]}
    {- macOS:
	[brew install sundials] / [port install sundials]}
}
Otherwise, the following section describes how to install Sundials
manually.
After installing Sundials, retry [opam install sundialsml].

{3:sundials Manually Building and Installing Sundials}

First
{{:https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software}download}
the Sundials source code.
It must be compiled with 64-bit floats (the default: {i
--with-precision=double}) and the C compiler must provide 32-bit
[int]s.

Building the extra features of Sundials requires the installation of
dependencies and the right cmake incantation.
In particular, it can be tricky to get the optional
{{:http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/#superlu_mt}SuperLU/MT}
library to work.

For {b Debian}-based systems, we found the following worked:
{ol
    {- {v apt-get install cmake liblapack-dev libopenmpi-dev libsuitesparse-dev v}}
    {- Optionally
    {{:http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/superlu_mt_3.1.tar.gz}download}
    and build SuperLU/MT 3.1.}
    {- {v mkdir build; cd build v}}
    {- {v cmake -Wno-dev ../sundials-6.1.0 \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DOPENMP_ENABLE=1 \
-DPTHREAD_ENABLE=1 \
-DMPI_ENABLE=1 \
-DKLU_ENABLE=1 -DKLU_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
-DKLU_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/suitesparse v}
       adding, optionally,
       {v -DLAPACK_ENABLE=1 -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES='-llapack -lblas' v}
       adding, if necessary,
       {v -DSUPERLUMT_ENABLE=1 \
-DSUPERLUMT_LIBRARY_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/lib \
-DSUPERLUMT_INCLUDE_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/SRC \
-DSUPERLUMT_LIBRARIES=-lblas v}}
    {- Build and install Sundials by running [make -j install].}
    {- Change to the Sundials/ML source directory and run
	{v ./configure v}
	Adding, if necessary,
	{v SUPERLUMT_INCLUDE_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/SRC \
SUPERLUMT_LIBRARY_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/lib \
KLU_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/suitesparse v}
       Note that [SUPERLUMT_LIBRARY_DIR] must be registered with [ld]:
	{v export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH v}}
    {- Run [make] to build the library and [make install] or [make install-findlib] to install it.}
}

For {b macOS}, we found the following worked:
{ol
    {- Optionally install
    {{:http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html}suite-sparse} with
    [brew install suite-sparse].}
    {- Optionally
       {{:http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/superlu_mt_3.1.tar.gz}download}
       and build SuperLU/MT.}
    {- {v mkdir build; cd build v}}
    {- For OpenMP, the gcc compiler is required:
       {v cmake -Wno-dev ../sundials-6.1.0 \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-11 \
-DOPENMP_ENABLE=1 \
-DPTHREAD_ENABLE=1 \
-DMPI_ENABLE=1 \
-DKLU_ENABLE=1 -DKLU_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/local/lib -DKLU_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include v}
       adding, optionally,
       {v -DLAPACK_ENABLE=1 v}
       adding, if necessary,
       {v -DSUPERLUMT_ENABLE=1 \
-DSUPERLUMT_LIBRARY_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/lib \
-DSUPERLUMT_INCLUDE_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1/SRC v}}
    {- Configure Sundials/ML with
	{v ./configure SUPERLUMT_DIR=<full-path-to>/SuperLU_MT_3.1 v}}
}

The Sundials/ML [configure] script detects and automatically enables optional
features.  Lapack solvers, like
{{!Sundials_LinearSolver.Direct.lapack_dense}LinearSolver.Direct.lapack_dense}, are enabled
if Sundials was built with lapack support
(see also {{!Sundials_Config.lapack_enabled}Sundials.Config.lapack_enabled}).
The KLU and SuperLU_MT solvers, and the Pthreads and OpenMP nvectors are
only enabled if Sundials was built with them.
Parallel nvectors and Band-Block-Diagonal (BBD) solvers
are only enabled if Sundials was built with them and OCamlMPI is available.

{3:build Manually Building and Installing Sundials/ML}

Building Sundials/ML from source is a three step process:
{ol
    {- {{:https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software}Download}
        and manually install Sundials,
        or use a package manager:
	{ul
	    {- Debian/Ubuntu (without parallelism):
                    [apt-get install libsundials-serial-dev]}
	    {- macOS: [brew install sundials] / [port install sundials]}
	}}
    {- Run [configure] to find and check dependencies.}
    {- Run [make -j install] or [make -j install-findlib] to build and
       install the library.}
}

The choices made by the configure script can be influenced by
arguments (like {i --prefix=...}) and variables (like
[OCAMLROOT=...]). Type [configure --help] for detailed information.

OCaml reimplementations of the standard Sundials examples are provided in
the [examples/] subdirectory.
The library's behaviour can be tested via [make -j tests.opt.log] which runs the OCaml
versions and compares their outputs against those of the original C
versions: they should be identical.
The library's performance can be analyzed via [make perf-intv.opt.pdf] which
produces the graph explained {{:#performance}below}.

The OPAM “pinning” feature is supported: perform step 1 above and then, from
the Sundials/ML source directory, run {v opam pin add . v}
Environment variables ([SUPERLUMT_LIBRARY_DIR], etc.) can be set to fine-tune
the build process.

{2:running Running programs}

{3:compilation Compiling and linking}

Programs are compiled by specifying where Sundials/ML is installed, e.g.,
{ul
    {- [-I +sundialsml],}
    {- or [-I `opam config var lib`/sundialsml],}
    {- or [ocamlfind ... -package sundialsml],}}
and including [sundials.cma], for example:
{v ocamlc -o myprog.byte -I +sundialsml sundials.cma myprog.ml v}
or the [.cmxa] versions:
{v ocamlopt -o myprog.opt -I +sundialsml sundials.cmxa myprog.ml v}
(For OCaml <= 4.06.*, [bigarray.cma] is also needed.)

The [sundials.cma/.cmxa] files link against the libraries
[libsundials_cvodes] and [libsundials_idas]. The code in these libraries
should give the same results as that in those without sensitivity analysis
(except for the functions {!Cvode.get_work_space} and {!Ida.get_work_space}),
even though they are compiled from distinct source files. The
[sundials_no_sens.cma/cmxa] files, on the other hand, link against the
libraries [libsundials_cvode] and [libsundials_ida] and thus do not include the
functionality in {!Cvodes} or {!Idas}.
Both sets of files link against
[libsundials_kinsol], [libsundials_arkode], and [libsundials_nvecserial].

The parallel features—in the {!Nvector_parallel}, {!Cvode_bbd},
{!Cvodes_bbd}, {!Ida_bbd}, {!Idas_bbd}, {!Kinsol_bbd}, and {!Arkode_bbd}
modules—require the
additional inclusions of [mpi.cma] and [sundials_mpi.cma]. So, for example:
{v ocamlc -o myprog.byte -I +sundialsml mpi.cma sundials.cma \
					sundials_mpi.cma myprog.ml v}
or with the [.cmxa] versions:
{v ocamlopt -o myprog.opt -I +sundialsml bigarray.cmxa mpi.cmxa sundials.cmxa \
					 sundials_mpi.cmxa myprog.ml v}
The [sundials_mpi.cm(x)a] files link against the
[libsundials_nvecparallel] library.

The [Nvector_openmp] and [Nvector_pthreads] modules require the additional
inclusion, respectively, of [sundials_openmp.cm(x)a] and
[sundials_pthreads.cm(x)a].

Under [ocamlfind], the parallel, OpenMP, and Pthreads features
are selected via subpackages, and the use of the libraries without
sensitivity analysis via a predicate.
For example, for everything:
{v ocamlfind ocamlopt -package sundialsml.mpi,sundials.pthreads,sundials.openmp \
				-linkpkg -o mysim.opt mysim.ml v}
The available packages and the features they select are:
{ul
    {- [sundialsml]: basic features; add [-predicates no_sens] to disable
    sensitivity, }
    {- [sundialsml.mpi]: additionally include MPI-based parallel nvectors,}
    {- [sundialsml.openmp]: additionally include OpenMP nvectors,}
    {- [sundialsml.pthreads]: additionally include Pthreads nvectors.}}

{3:toplevel From the toplevel}

Sundials/ML can also be used from the OCaml interactive loop, either by an
invocation like:
{v ocaml -I +sundialsml sundials.cma v}
or through [ocamlfind], for example: {[
#use "topfind";;
#predicates "no_sens";;	  (* optional: excludes sensitivity code *)
#require "sundialsml";;

let f t y yd = yd.{0} <- 1.;;
let g t y gout = gout.{0} <- y.{0};;
let y = Sundials.RealArray.of_array [| -1.0 |];;
let yvec = Nvector_serial.wrap y;;
let s = Cvode.(init Adams default_tolerances f ~roots:(1, g) 0. yvec);;
Cvode.set_stop_time s 2.;;

(* repeat the commands below to advance the simulation until t = 2.0 *)
let (t', result) = Cvode.solve_normal s 2. yvec;;
Format.printf "%e: %a\n" t' Sundials.RealArray.pp y;;]}

Using MPI from a toplevel is best done with [ocamlfind] by first creating a
custom toplevel:
{v ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o partop -package sundialsml.mpi,findlib -linkpkg v}

and then launching it in multiple terminals:
{v mpirun -np 2 xterm -e ./partop v}
Here, [2] is the number of processes, [xterm] is the terminal program, and
[-e ./partop] has each [xterm] execute [./partop].
As a simple test, paste the following into all terminals: {[
#use "topfind";;
#require "sundialsml.mpi";;

let comm = Mpi.comm_world
let n = Mpi.comm_size comm
let my_id = Mpi.comm_rank comm
let pv = Nvector_parallel.make 1 n comm (float_of_int (my_id + 1));;

Printf.printf "%d: local=%f.\n" my_id (Nvector_parallel.local_array pv).{0};;
Printf.printf "Sum of abs. = %f\n" (Nvector_parallel.Ops.n_vl1norm pv);;
]}

{3:solutions Solutions to common problems}

{ol
    {- The message
       {v Fatal error: cannot load required shared library dllmlsundials v}
       can usually be fixed by updating [LD_LIBRARY_PATH], for example,
       {v export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} v}
       Otherwise you may have compiled Sundials without
       [--enable-shared].}
    {- The configuration warning
       {v Couldn't determine C compiler flag for OpenMP. v}
       can usually be eliminated by specifying a compiler that supports OpenMP,
       for example,
       {v CC=gcc-11 ./configure v}}
}


{2:performance Performance}

An interface like Sundials/ML inevitably adds overhead: there is
extra code to execute at each call. But, how significant is this cost? And,
more broadly, how does the performance of OCaml compare to that of C for
programs that use numeric solvers?

These questions are not easy to answer. As a first attempt, we took the
examples in C from the Sundials distribution, reimplemented them in
OCaml and compared the execution times. The bars in the graph below show
the ratios of the execution times of the OCaml code to the C code, i.e., a
value of 2 on the left axis means that OCaml is twice as
slow. The black dots indicate, against the right axis, the execution
time of the C code.

The colored bars show the confidence intervals of the estimated
running times. More precisely, let {% $C$ %} and {% $O$ %} be random
variables representing the running times of an example coded, respectively,
in C and OCaml. The plot shows the range of {% $r$ %} such that the null
hypothesis {% $P(rC < O) = P(rC > O)$ %} is {i not} rejected at the 99.5%
confidence level.

{img perf-intv.opt.png}

The {{:perf-intv.opt.pdf}graph} shows that the OCaml examples are usually
less than 50% slower than the original ones, sometimes up to 100% slower,
and only very rarely any slower than that.
The [*_custom] example ({color #deebf7 light blue}) uses custom nvectors
with low-level operations in OCaml and the [*_alt] examples ({color #9ecae1
darker blue}) use linear solvers implemented in OCaml.
The OCaml library and examples were compiled in “unsafe” mode, that is,
without array bounds and other safety checks—the C code does not perform
these checks either.
The {{:perf-intv-safe.opt.pdf}results with safety checks} are also
available.

This conclusion seems reasonable as a first approximation, but several
details of the analysis process and individual results show that the real
situation is less clear-cut. For one, the running times of most of the
examples are so short that accurate profiling is not possible, i.e.,
{{:http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/time.html}time}
and {{:https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/}gprof} simply show 0
seconds.
The figures in the graph were obtained by modifying the examples to
repeatedly execute their [main] functions.
The number of repetitions varies per example since otherwise the slower
examples take too long.
The timings indicated by the dots and the axis at right are calculated by
dividing the wall-clock time of each C version by the number of repetitions.
All but six of the serial examples ({color #de2d26 red}) run so fast that 
comparisons are made based on tens, or usually hundreds of repetitions and
in some cases this amplifies factors other than the interface overhead.
The slowest example, for instance, [kin--ser--kinRoberts_fp] is iterated
nearly 200 000 times to achieve a significant wall clock time.
This means creating and destroying many more data structures than usual for
such code.
In fact, about 25% of the runtime is spent in garbage collection,
about 15% in allocating nvectors (10% in [calloc] alone),
about 10% in freeing memory on the C heap,
and about 15% calling [printf].
There is very little calculation in this example and thus bookkeeping
predominates (and OCaml does more of it than C).
Similar comments apply to the second slowest example,
[kin--ser--kinRoboKin_dns] (10% in garbage collection and 30% in [printf]
formatting numbers).

The running times of the parallel examples ({color #fc9272 lighter red})
often vary considerably between different runs.
Those with the highest variations—with the exception of
idaHeat2D_kry_bbd_p—often have relatively long running times
and the results are obtained in relatively few (< 10) iterations.

We were able to make our OCaml versions much faster (up to 4 times) by:
{ul
    {- Adding explicit type annotations to all vector arguments.
       For instance, rather than declare a callback with
       {[ let f t y yd = ... ,]}
       it is better to use
       {[ let f t (y : Sundials.RealArray.t) (yd : Sundials.RealArray.t) = ... ,]}
       or more concisely
       {[ let f : Sundials.RealArray.t Cvode.rhsfn = fun t y yd -> ...]}
       since then the compiler need not generate polymorphic code and
       can optimize for the bigarray layout.}
    {- Avoid functions like
       {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Bigarray.Array1.html#VALsub}[Bigarray.Array1.sub]}
       and
       {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Bigarray.Array2.html#VALslice_left}[Bigarray.Array2.slice_left]}.
       These functions allocate new bigarrays on the major
       heap, which increases the frequency of major GCs. They can often be
       avoided by calculating and passing indices more explicitly.
       When part of an array must be passed to another function, it
       can be faster, depending on the size, to copy into and out of a
       statically-allocated temporary array.}
    {- Sequences of {{!Sundials_RealArray2.get}RealArray2.get} and
       {{!Sundials_RealArray2.set}RealArray2.set} operations are usually better replaced by
       {{!Sundials_RealArray2.unwrap}RealArray2.unwrap}
       (projection from a tuple) and direct
       accesses to the underlying array.}
    {- Write numeric expressions and loops according to the advice in
	{{:#refs}\[4\]}
       to avoid float ‘boxing’.}
}

In summary, OCaml code using the Sundials solvers should almost never be
more than 50% slower than the equivalent code written in C, provided the
guidelines above are followed, and it should usually not be more than 30%
slower. It is usually, however, faster to write and debug OCaml code thanks
to automatic memory management, bounds checking on arrays, strong static
type checking, higher-order functions, etcetera. Moreover, the Sundials/ML
library offers a good comprise for programs combining symbolic manipulation and
numeric calculation.

The graph above can be generated from the Sundials source by running {[
cd examples; make perf-intv.opt.pdf GC_AT_END=1 PERF_DATA_POINTS=40
]}
Be sure to build Sundials with [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release] otherwise the
underlying library is unoptimized.
Sundials/ML should be configured with [-unsafe].
